## Step 1: Configuration SAML Application

Your Identity Provider (IdP) will ask for the following information while configuring the SAML application.

Please do not add a trailing slash at the end of the URLs.

Create them exactly as shown below:

<div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>
  <div>
    <InputWithCopyButton text={spConfig.acsUrl} label='Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)' />
  </div>
  <div>
    <InputWithCopyButton text={spConfig.entityId} label='Identifier (Entity ID)' />
  </div>
</div>

- Response: `Signed`

- Assertion Signature: `Signed`

- Signature Algorithm: `RSA-SHA256`

- Assertion Encryption: `Unencrypted`

The deployed Polis service has a Service Provider (SP) endpoint that exposes the above metadata and the same can be accessed at [SAML Configuration](/.well-known/saml-configuration).
