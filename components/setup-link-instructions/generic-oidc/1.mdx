## Step 1: Create Application

<div className='flex flex-col gap-4'>

    <InputWithCopyButton text={oidcCallbackUrl} label='Callback URL' />
  </div>

**Client/Application ID**

The OIDC Identity Provider normally will generate a unique identifier for the registered App. Make a note of this to be used later when creating the SSO connection with Polis.

**Client Secret**

Along with the Client ID, the IdP also generates a client secret which is used to authenticate the client while issuing tokens. Make a note of this to be used later when creating the SSO connection with Polis.

_Since Polis acts as a proxy between the app and the OIDC Identity Provider, here the application/client is Polis._
